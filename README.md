# FIFA-Team-Builder
Python genetic algorithm that retrieves information about the last 8 FIFA databases and selects the best team possible for a custom budget based on their overall and variance stats.\
To do so, we collected data on the players ratings and statistics from the FIFA games and used a combination of algorithms and manual analysis to determine which players had the highest overall ratings and which team presented the lowest variance. The resulting team represents the best possible combination of players based on the 
available data and can be used as a reference for creating a strong team in future FIFA games.\
This project was made for the Intelligent Sensorial Processing subject in the masters degree of Eletrical and Computer Engineering of NOVA School of Science and Technology.\
More information about the project is available on file FIFA_FinalProject_Report.pdf.
